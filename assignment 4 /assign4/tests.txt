Tests:
x canary test
x pass length of zero returns map of nothing
x pass length of one returns list of length one and price of one
x pass length of two returns list of length two and price of two
x pass length of five returns list of length five and price of five
x pass length of ten returns list of length three and price of eleven
x pass length of 11 returns list of length four and price of twelve
x pass length of 14 returns list of length seven and price of fifteen
x pass length which is not found returns zero price and no smaller cuts
x pass length of zero returns map of nothing using optimized version
x pass length of one returns list of length one and price of one using optimized version
x pass length of two returns list of length two and price of two using optimized version
x pass length of three returns list of length three and price of three using optimized version
x pass length of five returns list of length five and price of five using optimized version
x pass length of ten returns list of length three and price of eleven using optimized version
x pass length of 11 returns list of length four and price of twelve using optimized version
x pass length of 14 returns list of length seven and price of fifteen using optimized version
x optimized version is atleast 10 times faster than normal version and results in both cases are same
